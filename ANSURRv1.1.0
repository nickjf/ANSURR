ANSURR v1.1.0

Major changes 

Added the option to identify well-defined residues using CYRANGE and compute ANSURR scores over these regions (using it's own benchmark for well-defined residues only). Well and ill defined regions are indicated on flexibility plots. 


Minor changes

Updated correlation and RMSD benchmark values to reflect PDB structures available up to June 2021

Secondary structure and whether residues are well-defined or not are included in output text files

You can now type paths to shifts and structure as input

Residues with no chemical shift data (not used to determine ANSURR scores) are highlighted on flexibility plots as black crosses

Various loops now loop over structures in alphanumeric order (it looks nicer)
